# Microservice communication with RabbitMQ

## Issues to fix

- [ ] After a while, RabbitMQ connection to producer automatically stops saying : "missed heartbeats from client, timeout: 60s"

- [ ] None of the consumers are printing anything in the logs (console) using python's print statement (even though they are being executed)

- [ ] Read database not working
